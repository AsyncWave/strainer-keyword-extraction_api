Olfactory agents can disperse crowds with less risk of injury. No wonder Hong Kong citizens are dismantling their city to stymie the invading horde. | 0 | 0 | jdowdell | 2007-02-28 19:33:00 | 2647 | False | 132 | False | 41351 | 265 | 13922 | San Francisco | 'Make things easier for other people, improve the TU/FU ratio, and try to leave the intersection happier than you found it.' #trafficJDstyle | None | None

Police raise their shields, hooded agents throw cobblestones at them. 3. Police charge, hooded agents run away to incite stampede. 4.

Or that you are making up lies about a private citizen violating his rights and using a foreign government to cheat the voters?
